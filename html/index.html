            Hello! My name is Nikesh Sejuwal and I am a BSc. CSIT student. I
            have a passion for video editing, and I am currently honing my
            skills in HTML and CSS. My ultimate goal is to become a web
            developer, and I am particularly interested in developing web pages
            with JavaScript.
            <br />
            <br />
            In terms of my background, I have experience working on various
            video editing projects, including short films, and social media
            content. I enjoy experimenting with different editing techniques to
            create engaging and visually appealing videos.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to video editing, I am also interested in web
            development. I am currently learning HTML and CSS, and I plan to
            expand my knowledge with JavaScript. I am excited about the
            possibilities of using JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive
            web pages.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I am not working on video editing or coding projects, I enjoy
            hiking, traveling, and exploring new places. I also like to stay
            up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in video editing
            and web development.
            <br />
            <br />
            My goal with this portfolio is to showcase my skills and experience
            in video editing and web development. I am always looking for new
            opportunities to collaborate and learn from others in the industry.
            If you are interested in working together or have any questions,
            please feel free to reach out to me.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you for taking the time to read my "About" section, and I look
            forward to connecting with you!
